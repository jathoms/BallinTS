# BallinTS
Ballin bot, new and improved, and in Typescript!

# Usage

With this bot in a server, a user can use the /start command with a gamemode (optionally map/config) in order to create a lobby. Once the lobby is created, everyone joining will trigger a ready-up phase, once everyone is ready, a server will be reserved through serveme.tf and the people in the lobby will be sent a connect string.
